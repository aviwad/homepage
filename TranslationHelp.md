# LyricFever Translation Setup

You must download translation languages first before LyricFever can translate anything. It's very quick.

## Download all translation languages

### Open Language & Region in System Settings

[Click here to open the Language & Region page](x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.Localization-Settings.extension)

### Download all the relevant languages

For example, if your system language is English and you want to translate a Korean song, you must have both Korean and English installed.

IMPORTANT: For English, please download English (US).
